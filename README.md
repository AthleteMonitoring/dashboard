# Open Dashboard Project

## Aims:

- Build a free open source dashboard that clubs/teams/coaches/players/enthusiasts can use to visulise training monitoring or performance.
- Create a web app style dashboard (not in excel) that can be accessed online (...building to real-time and secure access).
- Teach coaches/sports staff basic coding skills so that they can create customed dashboards (if there is a need for training).
- Build relationships with clubs/teams/coaches/players/enthusiasts and see what we can do together (For starters; we will build a dashboard for you based on the data/specication of matrics you want analysed that you provide us...only a few of us in our spare time!!!)


## The Dashboard

**6 Nations Dummy Example**

We have created a dummy **CSV** dataset based on a rugby team, with positions, RPE, mins played, total load (mins * RPE) etc over 5 weeks of matches (numbers are created randomly). 

The layout of the dashboard is with a datatable at the top and interactive plots/charts underneath. The data can searched/filtered similar to that of tables in excel, with the plots/charts updating real-time to summerise the data selected.

## ...or present as many interactive plots/charts as needed

## Coming soon!

- Put up a live working demo for people to play around with (get thinking about what plots/charts might suit your data).
- develop other interactive plots/charts that link to the datatable (i.e scatter, pie, tree...).
- Setup guide so it can run locally by users.
- Do a nice video of the 6 Nations Dummy Example showing all features.
- Credit all the amazing work by others that make this possible!!!
